🩺 AI Medical Chatbot with Vision and Voice
An intelligent, multimodal AI-powered medical assistant that understands text, voice, and images. This project brings together Natural Language Processing, Speech AI, and Computer Vision to make basic medical guidance more interactive, accessible, and user friendly.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This chatbot is for educational and informational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.



✨ Why This Project Stands Out
Healthcare information is often difficult to access quickly and clearly. This project aims to bridge that gap by allowing users to talk, type, or upload images to receive AI-generated medical insights in real time.

It is designed as a learning-focused yet practical system that demonstrates how modern AI technologies can work together in a real-world healthcare-inspired application.
